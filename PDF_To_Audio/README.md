This project is a Streamlit-based PDF to Audiobook Converter that uses pdfplumber for extracting text from PDF files and pyttsx3 for converting the text into speech. It includes a user-friendly interface for uploading PDFs, generating audio files, and downloading them in MP3 format. The slugify function ensures that output filenames are clean and standardized.
